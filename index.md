<div style="text-align: justify">According to this sales data, the records of sales is from 2011 - 2016, with detail of products info, customers info and price and profit per product. Since we need to know which country have most buyers, how much profit the store make and what kind of products category have most sales, i will explore more about this data especially on country, state, sub category products and how much profit do they earn. This data exploration will answer these questions : What is the most product sales in every year? Who is the most segmented gender that buy the product? Where is the most product sold? When is the company have most profit margin? Why did the company should expand or not? and How is the increase or decrease of profit every year?</div>
